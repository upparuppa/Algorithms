1. Start from first element (index 0)
2. Check if arr[index] is equal to the key
3. If arr[index] is equal to the key, return the index. Otherwise, if arr[index] is not equal to the key, increment the index.
4. If the array has been completely-indexed through, then the element does not exist in the array.
